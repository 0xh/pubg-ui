# Install
- `yarn install` if you haven't installed the dependencies yet

# Running Dev
- `yarn start` to start the react app. By default it should serve on http://localhost:3000/. You can change this by editing the .env file.

# Running in PUBG
- Edit your hosts file
  - add `127.0.0.1 front.battlegroundsgame.com` to your hosts file to make front.battlegroundsgame.com resolve to localhost instead.
- `yarn build` to build the app into html/css/js.
- `yarn serve` to serve the app on port 80: http://localhost/
